# SQL Projects 

### This SQL project uses datasets from mode.com website. 

To get started, sign up on mode.com and click on the "+" sign to access the SQL editor. 
Here, you can go ahead and execute your SQL queries. (Case Study-1 is executed on mode.com)

We've used datasets from mode.com in our MySQL workbench (Case Study-2, Case Study-3 and Case Study-4)

Please remember the following steps: Open Mode.com, export the required dataset, and then open MySQL Workbench.

In MySQL Workbench:
1. Create a new database named 'sqlproject' using the command 'create database'.
2. Use the SQL command 'use sqlproject' to work in the specific database.
3. Import the .csv dataset downloaded from mode.com into the 'sqlproject' database.
4. Run the query 'SELECT * FROM table_name' to view your dataset.

Let's begin analyzing the data and deriving valuable insights. ;)
