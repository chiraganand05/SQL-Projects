# SQL Projects 
### Hello folks 

This section of SQL Case Study uses data from mode.com website. It's free to use, you just have to sign in. They have a huge resource of datasets to practice.

Steps I followed:

Login to mode.com
Export the required dataset(by default .csv format)
Open your MySQL Workbench.
Create a new database 'casestudies' using command 'create database casestudies'
Run the SQL command 'use casestudies' to work in the specific database
Import the .csv dataset downloaded from mode.com
The .csv dataset will be imported in current database i.e., 'casestudies'
Run 'Select * from table_name' to view your imported dataset.

Once all above steps are performed successfully, jump right into deriving insights from your data. Yay, happy exploring :)
